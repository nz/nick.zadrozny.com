<h3><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20john%202:15-16;&version=31;">1 John 2:15-16</a></h3>
<p>Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For everything in the world—the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does—comes not from the Father but from the world.</p>
