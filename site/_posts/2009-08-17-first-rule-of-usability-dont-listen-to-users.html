<h3><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20010805.html">First Rule of Usability: Don't Listen to Users</a></h3>
Classic wisdom on software development: speculation is the greatest enemy to usability.<blockquote><p>Ultimately, the way to get user data boils down to the basic rules of usability:</p><ul><li>Watch what people actually do.</li><li>Do not believe what people <em>say</em> they do.</li><li>Definitely don&#8217;t believe what people predict they <em>may</em> do in the future.</li></ul></blockquote>
Speculation is the greatest enemy to usability. The best thing any team can do for their customers is to constantly pursue a workflow that prioritizes frequent, focused releases and replaces speculation for observation as much as possible.
