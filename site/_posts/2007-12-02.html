<p>Particularly resonant with me is that, <q>some congregations are bypassing mission agencies when sending church members as missionaries. Winter criticizes this practice because churches lack the insights of missiology and the vast experience of mission agencies.</q> There are pros as well as cons to this approach, but as a growing trend how can it be creatively and properly supported?</p>
