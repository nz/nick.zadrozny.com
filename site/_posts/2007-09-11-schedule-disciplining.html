<ul><li><strong>Early morning:</strong> Project management: correspond, touch bases, review next action lists, send email and participate in meetings.</li>
<li><strong>Late morning:</strong> Do some writing then brew some coffee and spend a couple hours putting out fires and tackling the big, ugly tasks. Or just keep rolling with a productive morning meeting.</li>
<li><strong>Early afternoon:</strong> Sheer, in-the-zone productivity to meet this week&#8217;s development goals.</li>
<li><strong>Late afternoon:</strong> More coffee, more coding, and follow-up project management: demos, meetings and emails.</li>
<li><strong>Evening:</strong> Get a life! Unplug, invest in hobbies and relationships. Experiment with new tech for the fun of it.</li></ul><p>Each day focuses on a single project. Morning development will only vary from that when an urgent issue needs addressing or a big hairy project needs some extra initiative. Afternoon will be as unplugged and isolated as possible.</p>
