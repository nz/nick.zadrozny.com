title: To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly
  be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact, you
  must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal. Wrap it up carefully round
  with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the
  casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket—safe, dark, motionless,
  airless—it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable,
  irredeemable… The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from
  all the dangers of love is hell.
