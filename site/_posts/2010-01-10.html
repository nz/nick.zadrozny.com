<blockquote><p>Snofru was, in my opinion, the first adopter of Agile principles. His &#8220;employees&#8221; trusted him enough to be able to push back when the plan needed revising. He trusted them right back not to yank his chain about things being too steep. He made his mistakes up front, which taught him lessons about his domain, and it enabled him to be successful in the long run</p></blockquote><p>From the Pivotal Labs blog.</p>
