A classic, his advice is both liberating and challenging.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody goes through that… you gotta know, it&#8217;s totally normal. The most important thing you can possibly do is to do a lot of work… it&#8217;s only by actually going through a volume of work that you&#8217;ll close that gap.</p></blockquote>
