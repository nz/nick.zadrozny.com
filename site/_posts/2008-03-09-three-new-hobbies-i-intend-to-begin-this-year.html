<h3>Brewing my own beer</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s actually <a href="http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/makebeer/makebeer.html">pretty</a> <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Brew-Your-Own-Beer">straightforward</a>, but I bet the fun part is experimentally developing a really great recipe.</p>
<h3>Roasting my own coffee</h3>
<p>First: <a href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/archives/002681.php">roasting coffee in a popcorn popper</a>. Next: finding a good, inexpensive, fair trade green coffee bean. Also, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS/ref=nz-20">AeroPress</a> is pretty great, some of the best coffee I&#8217;ve ever had came out of one of these. Mine shows up in a few days.</p>
<h3>Managing my own World of Warcraft Guild</h3>
<p>Not really a <em>new</em> hobby in some ways, since I already play World of Warcraft. But in another month or so when Travis and I hit level 70, I hope to have already started recruiting for some <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Arathi_Basin_strategy">highly-tactical</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_versus_player">PvP</a> battleground and arena matches. It&#8217;s fun practicing leadership skills in a recreational setting.</p>
