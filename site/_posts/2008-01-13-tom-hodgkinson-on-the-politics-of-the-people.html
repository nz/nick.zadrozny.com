<h3><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/jan/14/facebook">Tom Hodgkinson on the politics of the people behind Facebook</a></h3>
<p>Most patently ridiculous quote I&#8217;ve read in an article of this sort: <q>After 9/11, the US intelligence community became so excited by the possibilities of new technology and the innovations being made in the private sector, that in 1999 they set up their own venture capital fund&#8230;</q></p>

<p>Wow. <q>After 9/11â€¦ in 1999.</q></p>

<p>Blatant errors, biases, and omissions aside, this rant is a very interesting take against Facebook. Taken with a few grains of salt it may even be useful. I think it&#8217;s important to consider the fundamental philosophies and world-views of something&#8217;s founder&#8217;s and backers.</p>
