<p>Had some good times here last night with the <a href="http://lrug.org/">London Ruby User Group</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>About the pub: The Crown is, for me, one of the best pubs in Clerkenwell. A year ago I wouldn&#8217;t have said that. The pub has an upstairs room which once hosted music hall performances. It&#8217;s reputed to be the location of a meeting between Lenin and Stalin in 1905, when the former was editing Iskra from 37a Clerkenwell Green a few doors down and the latter was in town to suck up to some party elders.</p></blockquote>
