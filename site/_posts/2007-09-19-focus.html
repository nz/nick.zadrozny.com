<p>Back and at it in San Diego. Thank the Lord that Disk Utility fixed <a href="http://nick.zadrozny.com/post/11347218">my broken OS X partition</a> without any real hassle, saving me 8-10 hours of mind-numbing maintenance. You can be sure I&#8217;m running some extra backups!</p>

<p>Finding myself too worn out from the drive to settle in properly, I spent the evening socializing with friends and playing around with my new Zoom H4. Its audio quality is beyond even what I hoped and looks to be perfect for my needs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a vague plan to start shooting quick five- and ten-minute expository sermons or newsletter-style updates to friends and family. A weekly grassroots sermon series would be fun, and I&#8217;ve got friends who are already excited about being involved. Now all I need is to save up for a decent digital video camera.</p>

<p>Over the next few days my main priority is simple: <em>focus!</em> I need to get back up and running at 100%, finishing up and paring down my excess workload, and being a good steward of my time and life. That includes deliberately limiting work to work hours and filling the rest of my time with good stuff. It&#8217;s good to have vision for a time like this.</p>
