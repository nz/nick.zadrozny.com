<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_compulsion">Repetition compulsion</a></h3>
<p><q>is a psychological phenomenon in which a person repeats a traumatic event or its circumstances over and over againâ€¦ For example, one may choose to stay with a &#8216;normal&#8217; pattern of pain and chaos instead of risking the perceived trauma of new experiences.</q></p>
