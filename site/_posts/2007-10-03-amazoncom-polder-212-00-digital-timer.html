<p>Just got this thing off Amazon.com and I think it was a great deal. It has a normal beeping alarm, plus vibrate or a flashing light, each of which is easy to turn on and off. It&#8217;ll be a great for seven-minute sprints, two-minute &#8220;just do it&#8221; tasks, art work or music practice. Plus it&#8217;s tiny.</p>
