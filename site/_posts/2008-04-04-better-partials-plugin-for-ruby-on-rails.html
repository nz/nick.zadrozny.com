<p>Looks promising. I&#8217;d call it syntactic sugar for rendering partials, but it&#8217;s more like a well-thought-out refactoring of a method that has seen a lot of growth and changes. I&#8217;ve already got it checked out in a branch on one of my current projects and will give it a go next time I&#8217;m doing view refactoring.</p>
