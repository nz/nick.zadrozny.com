<p>Now that there are <a href="http://zfs.macosforge.org/?page_id=5">New Binaries and Source</a> for <a href="http://zfs.macosforge.org/">ZFS on OS X</a> I have finally been able to run through this handy <a href="http://flux.org.uk/howto/solaris/zfs_tutorial_01">ZFS Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>It may not <em>quite</em> be production-ready for OS X yet (and, honestly, I&#8217;m not qualified to say at this point), but that&#8217;s no reason not to start experimenting. There&#8217;s plenty more to read on the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/zfs/">OpenSolaris ZFS</a> pages.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only a matter of time before I&#8217;m running the ultimate home file server/media server/NAS on a quiet little Mac Mini. In the mean time, does anyone out there want me to build an OpenSolaris file server cluster for their organization? :-)</p>
