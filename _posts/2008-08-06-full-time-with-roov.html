<p>I&#8217;d been working with <a href="http://roov.com/">ROOV.com</a> as an independent contractor for a few months now, and really enjoyed the vision and direction of the team. Just this month I have taken on a more involved role and am excited to be working full-time with ROOV.</p>

<p>Check out the site and let me know what you think so far. You can hit me up at <a href="mailto:nick@roov.com"> nick@roov.com</a> for ROOV-related things.</p>

<p><small><em>Also, we&#8217;re always on the lookout for good people! In particular, we&#8217;re currently looking for a stellar designer and another developer or two. Hit me up if you occasionally find yourself having conversations about Photoshop vs Illustrator, HTML vs XHTML, CSS frameworks vs CSS from scratch, RSpec vs Test::Unit, Rails vs Merb, Mootools vs JQuery, technology and postmodernism vs Christian traditionalism&#8230;</em></small></p>
