<p><ol><li><strong>Brainstorm</strong> features and goals for your site. Everything goes, just make sure it gets captured. Preferably on a big whiteboard, which is where synergy really comes in to play. </li><li><strong>Focus</strong> and refine your scope for the current iteration. Ruthlessly eliminate everything that is not absolutely essential. If the business will survive without it, you probably don&#8217;t need it yet. </li><li><strong>Tell stories</strong> with your features. Come up with a step by step narration in plain language of how a user is going to interact with your focused feature set.<br/></li><li><strong>Diagram</strong> the flow of functionality based on your user stories. A simple mind map is a very helpful tool to plan and track progress.  </li><li>Draw <strong>wireframe sketches</strong>, ignoring details, to get the big concepts down on paper. Revisit steps 2-4 as needed. </li><li>Develop <strong>plain HTML mockups</strong>, with no style or branding, just to see how all your ideas fit on a screen and whether any adjustments need to be made to accommodate browsers.<br/></li><li>Develop a <strong>functional interface</strong> with enough back end in place to make real changes. Now we&#8217;re working with real software and getting a sense of its usability. </li><li><strong>Polish it up</strong> by developing some layout comps using your overall identity, branding, and website style guide.</li><li><strong>Release it</strong> and start getting feedback from real users. Next week, start over at step 1. Have fun!<br/></li></ol><br/>For most of these steps you only need three people: a designer, a developer, and the client. Some of these steps need even fewer. This is a great workflow to be comfortable with. I like to run through this process as often as I can, at least once every two weeks if not more frequently.</p>
