<p>A friends and family post on the life and times of yours-truly. </p><p>My life&#8217;s pendulum has finally swung too far in the direction of work. Determined to put things in balance, I have lately been rediscovering old passions and lining up some hobbies to occupy non-work time. (So work and mindless web-browsing doesn&#8217;t!) </p><p><strong>Art</strong> — Just got my hands on and am about to start working through a book of drawing exercises. This&#8217;ll be one of my main hobbies this month: learning to look at the world more closely, and reproduce its lines, spaces, relationships, shadows, and gestalt.</p><p><strong>Music</strong> — My rudimentary grasp on musical theory, and novice to amateur-level technique on a handful of instruments, I hope to one day stoke into full-fledged composition. For now it&#8217;s getting my hands on an audio interface, graduating from Garage Band to Logic, deciding on a decent USB keyboard, and putting some more time into the piano. </p><p><strong>Reading</strong> — Okay, you got me, I&#8217;m not rediscovering this one, per se. But increased busyness often by necessity means better habits and increased productivity. Thus I have found myself into a few interesting books lately. Simultaneously. Focus, Nick.  </p><p><strong>Writing</strong> — This blog and <a href="http://beyondthepath.blogspot.com/">the other</a>. Random, and deeper, theological musings. Some web stuff. Still trying to decide who my audience is, besides my own brain, but I know communication is important, and writing profoundly so. Besides, it&#8217;s actually kinda fun so I might as well just dive in. Expository speaking (on video!) may come next once I &#8220;find my voice.&#8221; </p><p><strong>Running around</strong> — Getting some new shoes this weekend and back in the habit. It&#8217;s about time to train for a 5k (then a 10k, then a half-marathon, then a marathon). Throw some weight training in there (there&#8217;s a lot one can do without a gym membership) and my lifestyle starts to look healthy.<br/><br/>What are some others? I don&#8217;t know. Cooking? I saw cooking lessons at Whole Foods which I&#8217;d imagine to be quite amusing. Meals are always a great excuse to invite some friends over and talk about life. Dancing lessons? The thought has occurred to me. Maybe when I&#8217;ve got someone to dance with. Martial arts? Well, I like the idea of being fit and coordinated and able to defend the defenseless, but I&#8217;m still slightly working through that issue of faith and non-violence, not to mention averse to spending money on lessons. Sports? Never was very competitive, but I do enjoy the occasional game of pick-up volleyball or soccer. Computer games? Yeah I am into those enough as it is. Two nights a week playing some MMO with my brother could be appropriate and entertaining.<br/></p>
