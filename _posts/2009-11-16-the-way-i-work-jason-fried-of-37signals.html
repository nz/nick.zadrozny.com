<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t believe in the 40-hour workweek, so we cut all that BS about being somewhere for a certain number of hours. I have no idea how many hours my employees work &#8212; I just know they get the work done.</p><p>We rarely have meetings. I hate them. They&#8217;re a huge waste of time, and they&#8217;re costly. Creative people need unstructured time to get in the zone. You can&#8217;t do that in 20 minutes.</p><p>If anyone ever writes us with a complaint, our stance is it&#8217;s our fault â€” for not being clear enough or not making something work the way it should.</p></blockquote><p>Excellent and insightful article, full of all sorts of great quotes and concepts like the above. It reminds me that worthwhile disciplines provide a corresponding freedom, and no true freedom comes without challenges. For all their laid-back culture, I think the 37Signals folks are some of the most disciplined software developers out there.</p>
