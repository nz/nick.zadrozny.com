<p>Bravo, xkcd. Another point well-made on a concept that scales really well.</p>

<p>Consider: If you were to bill yourself for the time spent researching and making
purchases, how would the final cost influence your purchasing decisions?</p>

<p>Would it change how you spend your time? Would it change how your spent your money?
These questions hinge on two deeper, more revealing questions: how do you value
your time, and where are you most willing to spend it?</p>

<p>The comic above makes an excellent point: you probably aren’t willing to work for
less than minimum-wage just to save a few dollars on gas.</p>

<p>Conversely, there is an interesting question implicit in this point: What do you
value enough that you would work for less than minimum wage? Odds are that you’re
already doing just that.</p>
