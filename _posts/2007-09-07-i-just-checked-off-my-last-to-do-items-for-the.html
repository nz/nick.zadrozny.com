<p>I just checked off my last to-do items for the week. That felt really good. I&#8217;ve recently rediscovered <a href="http://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a> for helping to keep track of it all. I wasn&#8217;t busy enough to appreciate it when it was first released, but the way it groups tasks by time is really great if only because I can tell at a <em>glance</em> when I am done for the day.</p>
