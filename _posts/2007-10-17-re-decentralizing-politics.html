<p>What if our voting age requirements were tweaked a little? Perhaps we lower the age requirements for local and state elections, or even raise the age requirement for federal elections. What would the ramifications of such a change be? Would it help teach involvement in the political process, and, over time, decentralize the focus?</p>
