title: Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered
  to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything — all external
  expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just
  fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering
  that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you
  have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow
  your heart.
