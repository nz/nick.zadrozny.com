A decent breakdown, starting with the beans and the roast. Money quote: <blockquote><p><i>There&#8217;s no way around this: If you care about coffee, you have to grind the beans right before you make it. As soon as they&#8217;re ground, the oils inside the beans are exposed to air, and the thousand different flavor compounds inside start dying. Coffee&#8217;s fragile, man.</i></p></blockquote>Unfortunately, doesn&#8217;t mention the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS/ref=nz-20">AeroPress</a> which seems like a pretty serious omission to me. My recommended serious-coffee-drinker starter- (or tucked-away-in-an-office-cupboard-) kit:<ul><li>Freshly-roasted beans of your choice</li><li>A decent burr grinder</li><li>AeroPress</li><li>Good water and an electric kettle</li></ul>
