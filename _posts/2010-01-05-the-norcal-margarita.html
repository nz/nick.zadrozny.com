<p>The fitness geeks at CrossFit have been turning me into something of a nutrition geek of late. Along those lines, <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf&#8217;s</a> blog and Paleolithic Solution podcast have been hugely informative. Rather than attempt to summarize the paleo diet here, I encourage you to check out Robb&#8217;s blog and podcast if you are at all into exercise and nutrition. Good stuff.</p>

<p>One particular gem of a discovery is the NorCal Margarita. It&#8217;s a tasty adult beverage that the nutrition geek can enjoy, thanks to <em>science!</em></p>

<ol><li>2â€“3 shots of 100% agave tequila.</li>
<li>Juice and pulp from one lime.</li>
<li>Shake it all up with some ice.</li>
<li>Add soda water to taste.</li>
</ol><p>Also, I&#8217;ve found that it can help to make a few of them at a time, to average out the different sizes of limes.</p>

<p>This drink is wonderful, for a few reasons:</p>

<ol><li>Tequila is delicous.</li>
<li>Tequila is fermented agave juice, which makes it gluten- or and starch-free. Gluten, as nutrition geeks know, is a gut irritant and just generally bad stuff, and starches are way too dense with unnecessary carbs. Rum could likewise work well here.</li>
<li>Lime juice blunts the insulin response of the alcohol, maintaining your precious and hard-earned insulin sensitivity.</li>
<li>The lime juice also provides a net alkaline load when it gets to the blood stream, which is a good thing. Most other foods provide a net acid load, and it&#8217;s nice to balance that out.</li>
<li>The carbon dioxide bubbles in the soda water help get the ethanol into your blood more quickly. This has the practical effect of allowing you to drink a bit less for the same effect.</li>
</ol><p>Yum!</p>
