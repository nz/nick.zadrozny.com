<p>Trying to <a href="http://merbivore.com/get_merb.html">install the latest Merb</a> from source but having a problem with <code>rake install</code> for <code>merb-more</code>?</p>
<pre>(in /usr/local/src/merb/merb-more)
rake aborted!
no such file to load -- merb-core/tasks/merb_rake_helper
/usr/local/src/merb/merb-more/rakefile:12
(See full trace by running task with --trace)
</pre>
<p>Assuming you had no problems installing <code>merb-core</code>, then it&#8217;s likely that <code>merb-core</code>&#8217;s lib directory is only readable by root. Try the install again with <code>sudo</code>, then check the permissions on the gems you just installed to make sure they&#8217;re readable to everyone. On OSÂ X that might look something like this:</p>
<pre>chmod -R a+rX /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/merb*</pre>
